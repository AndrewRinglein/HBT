# Switches

Ambiguity gets exposed, not decided. Each row is a question the simulation can
answer; the default is what runs today.

**Answered switches keep their code path** so the alternative stays sweepable, but
the default freezes and the baseline uses it. Without recording the answers,
"baseline" stops meaning anything by month three.

| switch | question | default | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `critEnabled` | Is the crit system live? | `false` | open |
| `rangerPunchesWhenAdjacent` | Adjacent ranger: punch, or back off and shoot? | back off | open |
| `moveCostPerHex` | Does stamina cost per hex, or per move action? | per action | open |
| `recomputeStatsBetweenHits` | Does a stat gain from hit 1 apply to hit 2? | no | open |
| `multiAttackRetargets` | If the target dies, does hit 2 retarget or fizzle? | fizzle | open |
| `powerRollsToHit` | Do class powers roll to hit (and so crit)? | no — auto-hit | **not implemented** |
| `statusDecayRung` | Does a status decay at the tick rung, or at the later duration rung? | tick — act and decay in one pass | open |
| `absorbSpendOrder` | Which absorbing status pays first when several are held? | id order | open |
| `activationOrder` | Fixed by unit id, random, or best-first? | fixed | open |
| ~~all `terrain.*` values~~ | ~~cost and cover~~ | **NOT SWITCHES — specified in `GROUND-REQUIREMENTS.md` §1.1** | closed |
| `terrain.forest.cover` | Does forest hide you (+dodge), armour you (+armor), or both? | +10 dodge, +1 armor | open |
| `terrain.rocky.cover` | Is broken ground cover, or just slow? | +5 dodge | open |
| `terrain.water.penalty` | Does wading cost accuracy, or only movement? | −10 acc, −5 dodge | open |
| `hazardOnDowned` | Does terrain reach a downed hero? | not modelled — downed carry no statuses | answered |
| `protectionStacking` | A pulse of 2 onto a hero holding 1 gives 3 or 2? | additive | answered |

## Notes

**`statusDecayRung`** — `COMBAT-SEQUENCE.md` puts status ticks at rung 3 and
duration decay at rung 5, with a settle between. For a damage-over-time the damage
and the duration are the *same number*, so which rung owns the −1 is genuinely
ambiguous. Today both happen in one pass at rung 3. It makes no observable
difference until something can read or restore a status value between the two
rungs — a cleanse, an antidote, a refresh — at which point it decides whether that
effect gets one more tick out of the status or not.

**`absorbSpendOrder`** — with one absorbing status it cannot matter. With two of
different durations it decides whether you spend the one about to expire or the
one that would have lasted. Worth answering before a second shield exists.


## These were never switches — they were already specified

**2026-08-14, corrected.** The section below said I had invented terrain values and
should not have. That was true but incomplete. The values were **already written
down**, by Angela, in `GROUND-REQUIREMENTS.md` §1.1, dated 2026-08-13 — a day and a
half before the engine work — in the same folder, in a file named for the subject.

I never opened it. I read `MAP-01/map.json`, saw `moveCost: null` with the note
"design decisions, not generated data", and read that as *nobody has decided*. It
meant *not in this file*.

Three of the seven rows I shipped were wrong against that table, not one:

| row | §1.1 says | I shipped |
|---|---|---|
| `terrain.rocky` | cost 2 · **−5 Acc, +1 Armor, +1 Resist** | cost 2 · +5 Dodge |
| `terrain.water` | cost 2 · −10 Acc · **strips Burn/Poison** | cost 3 · −10 Acc, −5 Dodge |
| `terrain.rocky-hills` | cost 3 · **composed** | cost 2 · +10 Acc, +2 Reach |

**The rule this leaves behind:** before writing any content value, grep the design
folder for its id. `terrain.rocky` would have landed on §1.1 immediately. A value
with a stated owner is not an open question, and must never appear in this file.

### Still not built, from §1.1

- **Water strips Burn and Poison.** No mechanic exists for terrain removing a status.
- **`terrain.impassable` vs `terrain.obstacle`.** §1.1 names it `terrain.impassable`;
  MAP-01's legend calls it Obstruction with glyph `x`, and the engine uses
  `terrain.obstacle`. Two names, one thing — Angela's call, not mine.

## The original note, kept because a decision you reversed is still a decision

**2026-08-14.** `terrain.movecost` shipped with forest 2, rocky 2, rocky-hills 2,
water 3. Those numbers were mine. They were labelled switches, which reads as
"deferred", but a default nobody sweeps is a decision — and these went straight into
a balance sweep and got quoted back as findings.

Worse, `rocky-hills` was assigned a number by hand. It is rock **and** a climb, so
its cost is definitionally its components: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. A hand-set number for a
combination is always self-consistent and therefore never catchable — nothing can
disagree with it. Composing it from traits means the combination cannot drift from
its parts, and there is a test that fails if it ever does.

**The rule this leaves behind:** a switch may carry a default only when no
composition exists. If a value is the sum, product or consequence of other values,
it is derived, not switched — and putting it in this table is how it stops being
checked.
