# DECISIONS — rulings from Angela

Every other fact in this project has a home. Content has the numbered `*-SETTLED.md`
files. Work has `.state/backlog.json`. History has `.state/ledger.md`. Outcomes have
the gate.

Angela's rulings had no home. They existed only as spoken words in a conversation,
so answering "has this already been decided?" meant re-reading the conversation
instead of reading a file — and when that re-reading failed, the failure mode was
asking her the same question again. On 2026-08-15 that cost her four identical
rounds of the same four questions and about fifteen minutes.

This file is the home. **A question that has an entry here is closed. Do not ask it
again. If a ruling seems ambiguous, quote the entry and ask about the ambiguity —
never re-ask the original question from scratch.**

Rules for this file:

- Record her words verbatim. Paraphrase loses the reasoning, and the reasoning is
  what makes the ruling reusable when a new case turns up.
- Date every entry.
- A ruling stays here even after it is implemented. "Already built" is not a reason
  to delete it — the entry is what stops the question being reopened later.
- Never add an entry for something she did not actually say.

## 2026-08-15 — Ranged attacks: who moves?

**Ruled: the engine moves the unit. The design is right as written.**

Asked three times before it stuck, which is the incident that produced this file.
Implemented and landed. Not open.

## 2026-08-15 — Bleed-out: how long, and when does it resolve?

**Ruled: five rounds, resolving at the end of the hero phase.**

Implemented and landed. When re-asked on 2026-08-15 she expressed no further
preference, which is not a reopening — the original ruling stands.

## 2026-08-15 — `excludeSelf`: does an effect ever need to skip the actor?

**Ruled: no. Never. The field is deleted.**

> "I don't think we're ever gonna use exclude self. Because it's already either
> including or excluding heroes or things by target, but I don't think self will
> ever be one of those."

The actor is always one of its own allies, with no opt-out. Side and `requireTags`
are the two axes an effect discriminates on; "everyone but me" is not a third one.
Landed as `03a87e0`. This removed the last `ANGELA TO CONFIRM` in `src/`.

## OPEN — What counts as a published source?

Not yet ruled. Stated here so it is not re-asked in a different shape.

`tools/content-check` accepts exactly one kind of evidence that a piece of content
was really decided: a table row in one of the numbered `*-SETTLED.md` files.
`GAME-DESIGN.md` §5 already carries a table specifying Burn, Bleed, Weakness,
Regeneration and Stunned with their effects and decay rates, but the checker does
not look there — so those five read as undecided, and building them is blocked.
This is why `status.burn` was built and then reverted.

The question is only which document commits: does §5 count, or should those rows
land in `1-EFFECTS-SETTLED.md` first?

Riding on it: four engine paths that are built and have never once executed —
Protection absorbing, Weakness reducing damage, Stun blocking a turn, and Burn
halving healing.

## 2026-08-15 — Attacks and powers: what they actually carry

Correcting an engine-session error. `HERO-RECORD.md` v1 described `AttackDef` out of
`src/content/index.ts` — provisional scaffolding — as though it were the design.
`GAME-DESIGN.md` §4 and §5 are the source.

**An attack carries:** stamina cost · damage type · reach (on the weapon; hero Reach
adds to ranged only) · the governing stat (Strength melee, Precision ranged) · the
damage modifier · **triggers** · **type modifiers to damage**.

**A power carries all of the same, plus a cooldown** — and instead of triggers it has
**effects**.

> "Powers have all these same things and cooldowns. Because they don't have triggers,
> because they really have effects. Powers have a variety of effects, like they can
> have area effect attacks and they can heal."

She also asked whether the engine's `kind` field is what she means by damage type. It
is not: `kind` is melee/ranged and `damageType` is physical/magic/true. Two fields.

Consequences for the engine, all open: attacks have no `triggers` field (only a single
`applies` status rider) and no target-type modifier; and `AbilityDef` has no effects at
all, so no power can heal or hit an area today.

## 2026-08-15 — The design document is the source

> "We have a highly detailed design document, which I've talked about extensively, and
> then you're defining attacks as two stats?"

`GAME-DESIGN.md` (~64k) is canonical. `src/content/index.ts` is scaffolding an engine
session invented and labelled as such at the top of the file. **Describe the design from
the design document.** Reading the content file and reporting its shape as the design is
the error that produced `HERO-RECORD.md` v1.
