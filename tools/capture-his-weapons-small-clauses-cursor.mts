// capability.his-weapons-small-clauses (2026-10-05; DECISIONS.md 2026-10-04 'his 28 reward weapons read back …': "Everything else in
// here seems like something we need."), Law 10: an attack's on-kill may destroy the corpse of what it kills (the Staff of the
// Destroyer's Ruin and Sundering, the artifact attribute Destroying), and a power removes points of a named status by a stat's
// amount (the Benevolent Rod's Mending Light). A case that was fought before moves only if a unit in it holds one of those rows;
// test.corpse-destroyed and test.mending-light are ADDED: each clause live in a real battle.
// Freeze every case's full hashes on this tree. `changed` marks the cases whose full events OR state differ from the
// raise-lower-magic capture (the layer below); `movedOnlyText` says the state, RNG and result are all unchanged; `added` marks a
// case the layer below does not hold. Refuses to overwrite (flag wx), like the captures it copies.
